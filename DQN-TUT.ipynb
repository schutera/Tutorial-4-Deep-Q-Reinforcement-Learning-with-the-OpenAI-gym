    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will attempt to implement a Deep-Q-Network that is able to do a classic control. The approaches are build upon the paper by DeepMind: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning [paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf), which first introduces the notion of a Deep Q-Network.\n",

    "<center> Fig. 1: Breakout environment of the Atari game </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core idea\n",
    "As you probably remember from the lecture, during trial and error we can learn a policy for our Atari game, and model it within our Q-matrix. This is done with a deep neural network. After training, this Q-matrix gives us an estimate of the expected reward when taking action a in state s: Q(s, a).\n",
    "Playing the action with the maximum Q-value in any given state is the same as playing optimal, or following a full exploitation strategy.\n",
